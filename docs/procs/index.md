# procs

Procs (or processors) can do everything from augmenting the points in a stream
to remove them completely from said stream. There are quite a few built in ones
and you can always create your own. 

## built-in

 * [diff](diff/)
 * [filter](filter/)
 * [head](head/)
 * [intersect](intersect/)
 * [keep](keep/)
 * [put](put/)
 * [remove](remove/)
 * [seq](seq/)
 * [sort](sort/)
 * [tail](tail/)
 * [union](union/)
