# flume documentation

**flume** (pronounced *floom*) is a stream processing framework that can be
used to create streaming pipelines with code in a reusable and dynamic manner.
These pipelines can read data from different types of sources through [adapters](adapters/index.md)
and can write data out to [adapters](...) as well as visualizations through
[views](views/index.md).
